Howdy! A few people have mentioned that they’d like to do some little exercises to sharpen up their coding skills a little, so I thought I’d try to kick something off.
My current thinking is:
Post a problem every two weeks
Everyone hacks away either on their own or with others if they wanna
We get together at the end of the two weeks and see where we got to
Repeat until bored!
This is totally going to be driven by all of us, so let’s tweak it as we go along, but that feels like a reasonable way to get started. Sound okay?
Other vague thoughts:
Use whatever language you fancy -- these are good practice for picking up new languages or for practising your current language of choice
Have a mix of problems -- different difficulties, different types of problems, let’s mix it up a bit
Feel free to start and not finish -- even if you don’t get to the end, just starting and half completing stuff is a good exercise
All levels welcome. This is about learning new stuff and experimenting, so let’s leave our impostor syndrome at the door and have a go.
Sound okay?
With that in mind, here’s what I thought we might have a hack at this week. It’s a bit of an odd one, but I like that there are multiple stages in it so everyone can have a go and see how far they get.
